<h1> Saloon Survival - Mobile Top Down Shooter</h1>

<h2> Player Design </h2>
<p> The main character for the game will be a cowboy with a single pistol trying to survive as long as possible in the wild west, as the only survivor of the town being invaded by a swarm of robbers. </p>

<h2> Enemy Design </h2>
<p> I shall have two types of enemy, one with be quicker than the other and the other shall have more health. This is to combat the potential boredom of just fighting one character. In addition this, I do aim to have a propotion of the enmies shooting weapons too, so the enemies can do melee and ranged attacks, yet again to combat potential the game being stagnant. </p>

<h2> Map Design </h2>
<p> These are images of the final map. The highlighted green areas are blocking volumes so the character cannot escape the map. I started of by using the demo scene from the asset pack I found. Then fleshed it out to have close areas, areas that only have one way out and spacious areas. This was to keep the game interesting with a reange of high and low intensity areas so the game is not just one pitch throughout. This also allows player to create a playstyle and have some strategy about the movement of their character.</p>
